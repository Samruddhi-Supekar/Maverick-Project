## Summary of the Business Problem and Project Objective
Maverik's expanding operations require accurate sales predictions for new stores, emphasizing the need for forecasting models to project annual and daily sales in key segments. The project aims to enhance financial planning, resource allocation, and operational efficiency. By adjusting predictions based on past performance data, the solution intends to provide Maverik with a strategic edge in decision-making. Success metrics include forecast accuracy, financial impact, and improved operational efficiency. The resulting forecasting model will be integrated with Maverik's data sources, delivering a powerful tool for informed decision-making and sustainable growth.


## Solution to the Business Problem
Our group's solution to the business problem involved a meticulous exploration of various time series and machine learning models to predict annual and daily sales for Maverik's new store locations. While initial time series modeling effectively captured seasonality, the resulting high RMSE values prompted a shift to alternative models. Additionally, feature importance analysis proved crucial, with the elimination of low-importance features significantly enhancing model accuracy. Looking ahead, our proposed solution involves leveraging an optimized XGBoost model and Prophet model to inform a time series model, addressing the impact of seasonality. This approach allows for the gradual incorporation of actual sales data, aligning with Maverik's business objective of accurate and strategic forecasting for new store openings.


## Contribution to the project
In the project, my primary contribution focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of Time Series Models. During the EDA phase, I conducted a thorough analysis of the dataset, identifying patterns and trends. This step was crucial in understanding the underlying structure of the data and informing the subsequent modeling process. For the Time Series Models, I employed various techniques to capture and predict sales patterns over time. This involved selecting appropriate features and evaluating performance metrics like RMSE. My efforts in EDA and Time Series Modeling aimed to provide valuable insights into Maverik's sales data, contributing to the overall success of the forecasting solution for new store openings.


## Difficulties that the group encountered along the way
Our team faced challenges in the modeling phase of the project. Dealing with the impact of holidays and managing a small sample size required careful consideration. Additionally, excluding one store type out of the five posed limitations, which could affect the general applicability of our findings. Overcoming these challenges is essential to improve the reliability and effectiveness of our analysis.


## The business value of the solution
The solution provides significant business value for Maverik by accurately forecasting annual and daily sales for new store locations. This precision enhances financial planning and resource allocation. The models improve accuracy, aiding in the creation of reliable ROI. The integration of an optimized XGBoost model and Prophet model addresses seasonality, aligning predictions with actual sales data. The overall impact is informed, data-driven decision-making, fostering sustained growth and minimizing risks associated with new store openings.

## Learnings from this project
In the course of the project, I gained valuable insights into the complexities of sales forecasting and data analysis. The challenges we encountered provided hands-on experience in navigating real-world obstacles in data science projects. Working on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and time series modeling enhanced my proficiency in understanding and interpreting data patterns. This experience gave me a better understanding of the complexities of predictive modeling. Overall, the project significantly deepened my practical knowledge and skills in data analysis, modeling, and problem-solving within a business context.
